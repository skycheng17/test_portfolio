    "text": "Project Brief\nAs the world continually modernizes, the “digital divide” - a term describing disparity in access to technology - persists, placing certain groups at a distinct disadvantage. In particular, the recent global pandemic shed light on the inequality of digital access worldwide. Due to a substantial reliance on the internet for communication by a significant portion of the global population, individuals without access experienced even greater social and mental burdens during the pandemic. As a result, our team sought out to understand the varied digital equity landscape at the international, federal, and state levels through geospatial data analysis. In our project, we followed a set of guiding questions:\n\nWhat international metrics may inform digital equity in developed vs developing countries?\nIs there equitable access of ICT technology across the United States?\nHow does the digital divide persist in rural vs urban areas at various scales?\n\nA large part of the conversation about resolving the digital divide focuses on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) as well as telecommunications availability. As a result, we selected our main data source - a cell tower location database provided by OpenCellID. Managed by Unwired Labs, this collaborative initiative aggregates data from registered contributors.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\nIn our exploratory analysis, we created over a dozen data visualizations to evaluate cell tower data at the international, federal, and state level. These visualizations condensed over 200 million data points into comprehensible and actionable information. Here are a few visualizations that I contributed to the section I lead, the international cell tower coverage section:\n\n\n\nEvery cell tower in the world, mapped using OpenCellID data.\n\n\nThis map is a product of big data wrangling and data shading/condensing, and provides an overarching understanding of the cell tower coverage across different countries and regions.\n\n\nCode\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport altair as alt\nimport geopandas as gpd\n\ncolor_key = {\"GSM\": \"#707390\",\n             \"CDMA\": \"#93b7be\",\n             \"UMTS\": \"#e0ca3c\",\n             \"LTE\": \"#b59ab8\",\n             \"NR\": \"#048a81\"}\n\ngdp_per_capita = pd.read_csv(\"./Data/gdp_per_capita.csv\") #data from world bank\ngdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita[['Country Name', '2021 [YR2021]']]\ngdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita.rename(columns={\n    'Country Name': 'country',\n    '2021 [YR2021]': 'gdp_per_capita'\n})\ngdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita.dropna(subset=['country'])\npopulation = pd.read_csv(\"./data/population.csv\") #data from world bank\npopulation = population[['Country Name', '2021 [YR2021]']]\npopulation = population.rename(columns={\n    'Country Name': 'country',\n    '2021 [YR2021]': 'population'\n})\npopulation = population.dropna(subset=['country'])\ngpc_pop = population.merge(gdp_per_capita, how='left', on='country')\n\ncountries = gpd.read_file(\"https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries/r/countries.geojson\")\ncountries = countries[['ADMIN', 'geometry']]\ncountries = countries.rename(columns={'ADMIN': 'country'})\n\ngpc_pop_countries = countries.merge(gpc_pop, how='left', on='country')\n\ncountries_towers = pd.read_csv(\"./Data/international_cell_towers.csv\")\n\nmerge = countries_towers.merge(gpc_pop_countries, how='left', on='country')\nmerge.rename(columns={'UMES': 'UMTS'}, inplace=True)\n\ntower_types = ['UMTS', 'GSM', 'LTE', 'CDMA']\nmerge['dominant_tower_type'] = merge[tower_types].idxmax(axis=1)\n\nmerge['cell_towers'] = pd.to_numeric(merge['cell_towers'], errors='coerce')\nmerge['population'] = pd.to_numeric(merge['population'], errors='coerce')\nmerge['gdp_per_capita'] = pd.to_numeric(merge['gdp_per_capita'], errors='coerce')\nmerge['ctw_per_capita'] = merge['cell_towers'] / merge['population']\n\nmerge_df = pd.DataFrame(merge)\nmerge_df.drop(columns=['geometry'], inplace=True)\nmerge_df = merge_df.dropna()\n\nbrush = alt.selection_interval(encodings=['x'])\nclick = alt.selection_point(encodings=['color'])\n\npoints = alt.Chart(merge_df).mark_circle().encode(\n    alt.X(\"gdp_per_capita:Q\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False, type=\"log\"), title=\"Log GDP per Capita\"),\n    alt.Y(\"ctw_per_capita:Q\", scale=alt.Scale(type=\"log\"), title=\"Log Cell Towers per Capita\"),\n    size=alt.Size(\"population:Q\", title=\"Population\"),\n    color=alt.condition(brush, alt.Color(\"dominant_tower_type:N\", title=\"Dominant Tower Type\", scale=alt.Scale(domain=list(color_key.keys()), range=list(color_key.values())),), alt.value('grey')),\n    tooltip=\"country\",\n).properties(width=500, height=350).add_selection(brush).transform_filter(\n    click\n)\n\nbars = alt.Chart(merge_df).mark_bar().encode(\n    x='count()',\n    y=alt.Y(\"dominant_tower_type:N\", title=\"Dominant Tower Type\"),\n    color=alt.condition(brush, alt.Color(\"dominant_tower_type:N\", title=\"Dominant Tower Type\"), alt.value('lightgray')),\n).transform_filter(brush).properties(width=550).add_params(\n    click\n)\n\n# Combine charts\nalt.vconcat(points, bars, title=\"World Cell Tower Coverage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this interactive chart, we can analyze different countries’ advancement in cell tower technology with respect to their population, GDP per capita, and cell tower per capita. Interact with the chart by selecting sections of the scatter plot to see counts of countries’ dominant tower types (only GSM, LTE, UMTS), or click on each of the dominant tower types on the bar plot to see only countries of that tower type. The size of the countries’ populations are also represented through the size of the points, which you can hover over to find the country name. Note that GDP per capita and cell towers per capita on the scatter plot have been logged. Click the arrow above the charts to unfold the code.\nThe accompanying chart reveals not only a correlation between the logarithmic representation of cell towers per capita and GDP per capita but also a discernible trend. Less developed countries, as indicated by the GDP per capita metric, tend to exhibit a dominance of less advanced tower types such as GSM (2G), in contrast to more developed countries that are more inclined to have UMTS (3G) or LTE (4G) as the type most prevalent.\n\n\nProject Outcomes\nThis project and its code has been posted on the MUSA 550 Fall 2023 website created by my instructor, Dr. Nick Hand. Find the full post of the Exploring Digital Equity project here.\nIn conclusion, our project successfully explored digital equity through cell tower data at multiple levels. The analysis not only provided a global understanding of technology distribution but also examined into the complexity of cellular landscapes in the United States and the challenges faced by rural areas. The project’s use of geospatial data science and analysis showcased the power of data science in uncovering patterns, correlations, and disparities related to cellular infrastructure. Ultimately, the findings contribute valuable insights to the ongoing conversation about bridging the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to technology on a global scale.\n\n\nData Sources\n\nOpenCellID\nWorld Bank\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC)\nCenter For Rural Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania Spatial Data Access\nUnited States Census Bureau\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Project Brief\nIn this project, my team and I had the opportunity to explore an urban issue and tackle it using urban sensors we designed and created ourselves. A few key issues we identified and wanted to address:\n\nMany kids are playing on tattered playgrounds or abandoned parking lots on the sides of public schools.\nUpdating playground equipment can cost $8,000-$50,000.\nThere is no substantial line item in the Philadelphia School District’s annual budget to support upgrading playgrounds.\nCurrently, a piecemeal system of public-private partnerships funds the handful of schoolyard-improvement projects\n1 in 5 youth in Philadelphia, the majority of whom are black or Hispanic, are overweight or obese. 70% in North Philly which is nearly double the obesity and overweight rate for youth in the United States. (Source)\n\nIn response to these findings, we prototyped a suite of interactive playground installations that we believe would not only support physical activity and learning, but could work as a powerful pilot program for transforming underserved schools and communities across the city of Philadelphia: DigiPlay.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy team and I with our final prototypes. From left to right: Gustell Preston, Stephanie Cheng, Shreya Bansal, Noah Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn creating our prototypes, we also used laser cutting, soldering, and countless different wiring and coding configurations to achieve our desired digital playground installations.\n\n\n\n\nDigiPlay works to solve this challenge of inequitable access to play by transforming dull play spacing into interactive, digitally-latent ones that encourage movement and serve as another avenue for learning and education in schools. Our solution has three major components, outfitting schools that already had some play equipment with DigiPlay sensors, Creating digital experiences for schools with no play equipment, and layering on educational components of the playground. Additionally, our solution is cost effective for schools to adopt, with 1-3 interactive installations on a playground costing about ~$300 to install and another ~$100 to maintain on a yearly basis. Thus, DigiPlay is an inexpensive way to explore the transformative potential of embedded technologies in our built environment.\nThis project is a culmination of the skills gained in the Spring 2023 Sensing the City class taught by my instructor and advisor, Professor Allison Lassiter. Find the full post of the DigiPlay project on that website here.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\nIn our exploratory analysis, particularly when identifying which schools to employ this project, we looked at the proximity of playgrounds to schools and environmental features. To test our pilot, we chose a school closer to base called the Albert M. Greenfield playground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Outcomes\nIn total, we designed and prototyped four digital playground installations:\n\nHeart-rate sensor wall module and Musical jungle gym\n\n\n\nInteractive playfield\n\n\n\n\nPrototype testing\n\n\nThe DigiPlay full project and presentation slidedeck include more information, such as technical specifications, wiring and Arduino code tutorials, project phasing and scaling, etc.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Often, a person’s recovery is non-linear, includes setbacks and does not have a clear end point. This can make visualizing a journey difficult, because there is no “typical” recovery.\nThe perfect recovery process is the one perfect for that person. The best recovery process is one that meets an individual exactly where they are, free of external barriers and judgment, and full of respect and compassion.\nRelapse can happen during recovery. An individual can relapse but this does not mean that their recovery is over.\nMindset for recovery. Recovery can only begin when a person is ready. Until that point, their access to harm reduction education and harm reduction services is extremely important.\nRole of long-term relationships between individuals with OUD and agencies that provide recovery services. Thanks to these long term relationships, a person knows where to turn when they are ready for help.\nStigma and recovery. If an individual was treated poorly in the past by an emergency response person or at a healthy clinic, they may refuse treatment in the future. Some abstinence-based treatment programs do not condone substance use of any kind, including MAT. Stigma exists within advocacy in the form of promoting Vivitrol, which has disadvantages when compared to buprenorphine, but cannot be diverted.\nBenefit of “Lived Experience”. When case managers can share that they have “lived experience” and are in recovery themselves, it often makes individuals more comfortable. These case managers are able to offer compassion because they have been through withdrawal and some of the same challenges themselves.\nVulnerable Populations. While there may not be a typical recovery story, it is certain that there are populations for whom there exist even more obstacles to recovery. These vulnerable populations include: homeless, uninsured, mothers, formerly incarcerated, and people with a dual diagnosis of OUD and mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The project emphasizes on local knowledge, a novel way of looking at the data and creative factors that might enhance predictability of Zillow’s modeling. While Zillow’s model works satisfactorily, this approach offers a different lens into how the model could be built stronger with intel from a variety of internal and external factors, such as amenities like schools, parks, public spaces, as well as demographic data like poverty rates, median income, crime, etc.\nIn addition to the hedonic model, this project focussed on cross validation through evaluating mean absolute error/percent error and conducting Moran’s I testing.
